      <p>
        I created a webpage about SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals using HTML and CSS. I designed the layout with a sidebar for navigation and used Flexbox and Grid to organize the content and images neatly. I also added borders to separate sections and make the page more visually structured. This project helped me understand how to build responsive layouts and use CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid effectively. It also gave me a chance to highlight the importance of global cooperation in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
