      <p>
        I created my resume using HTML to showcase my skills, background, and interests in a clean and organized format. This project helped me practice structuring content with semantic HTML and gave me a better understanding of how websites are built. It includes sections like my education, skills, hobbies, and contact details. I also used a bit of CSS to improve the design and make it more visually appealing.t is a fully responsive personal resume website built using HTML and CSS, designed to present personal and professional information in a clean, modern layout. It features a visually appealing design that adapts seamlessly across devices, ensuring accessibility and readability.
