      <p>
       I created a simple HTML project to showcase my favorite Sustainable Development Goal, which is "Peace and Justice" (SDG 16). In this project, I used basic HTML to display the SDG icon and wrote a short paragraph explaining why I chose this goal. I wanted to raise awareness about the importance of ending poverty and how it connects to other global issues. This activity helped me practice my HTML skills while also sharing something meaningful to me.s a fully responsive personal resume website built using HTML and CSS, designed to present personal and professional information in a clean, modern layout. It features a visually appealing design that adapts seamlessly across devices, ensuring accessibility and readability.
